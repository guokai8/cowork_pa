Abstract = {{Introduction Alterations in cell cycle regulators have been implicated
   in human malignancies including breast cancer. PD 0332991 is an orally
   active, highly selective inhibitor of the cyclin D kinases (CDK) 4 and
   CDK6 with ability to block retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation in the
   low nanomolar range. To identify predictors of response, we determined
   the in vitro sensitivity to PD 0332991 across a panel of molecularly
   characterized human breast cancer cell lines.
   Methods Forty-seven human breast cancer and immortalized cell lines
   representing the known molecular subgroups of breast cancer were treated
   with PD 0332991 to determine IC(50) values. These data were analyzed
   against baseline gene expression data to identify genes associated with
   PD 0332991 response.
   Results Cell lines representing luminal estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)
   subtype (including those that are HER2 amplified) were most sensitive to
   growth inhibition by PD 0332991 while nonluminal/basal subtypes were
   most resistant. Analysis of variance identified 450 differentially
   expressed genes between sensitive and resistant cells. pRb and cyclin
   D(1) were elevated and CDKN2A (p16) was decreased in the most sensitive
   lines. Cell cycle analysis showed G(0)/G(1) arrest in sensitive cell
   lines and Western blot analysis demonstrated that Rb phosphorylation is
   blocked in sensitive lines but not resistant lines. PD 0332991 was
   synergistic with tamoxifen and trastuzumab in ER+ and HER2-amplified
   cell lines, respectively. PD 0332991 enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen
   in cell lines with conditioned resistance to ER blockade.
   Conclusions These studies suggest a role for CDK4/6 inhibition in some
   breast cancers and identify criteria for patient selection in clinical
   studies of PD 0332991.}},

   Inhibitors in Basal-Like Breast Cancer Models}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The pathways underlying basal-like breast cancer are poorly
   understood, and as yet, there is no approved targeted therapy for this
   disease. We investigated the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase
   kinase (MEK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors as
   targeted therapies for basal-like breast cancer.
   Experimental Design: We used pharmacogenomic analysis of a large panel
   of breast cancer cell lines with detailed accompanying molecular
   information to identify molecular predictors of response to a potent and
   selective inhibitor of MEK and also to define molecular mechanisms
   underlying combined MEK and PI3K targeting in basal-like breast cancer.
   Hypotheses were confirmed by testing in multiple tumor xenograft models.
   Results: We found that basal-like breast cancer models have an activated
   RAS-like transcriptional program and show greater sensitivity to a
   selective inhibitor of MEK compared with models representative of other
   breast cancer subtypes. We also showed that loss of PTEN is a negative
   predictor of response to MEK inhibition, that treatment with a selective
   MEK inhibitor caused up-regulation of PI3K pathway signaling, and that
   dual blockade of both PI3K and MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
   signaling synergized to potently impair the growth of basal-like breast
   cancer models in vitro and in vivo.
   Conclusions: Our studies suggest that single-agent MEK inhibition is a
   promising therapeutic modality for basal-like breast cancers with intact
   PTEN, and also provide a basis for rational combination of MEK and PI3K
   inhibitors in basal-like cancers with both intact and deleted PTEN.}},

Title = {{Development and Validation of a Novel Platform-Independent Metastasis
   Signature in Human Breast Cancer}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   The molecular drivers of metastasis in breast cancer are not well
   understood. Therefore, we sought to identify the biological processes
   underlying distant progression and define a prognostic signature for
   metastatic potential in breast cancer.
   Experimental design
   In vivo screening for metastases was performed using Chick
   Chorioallantoic Membrane assays in 21 preclinical breast cancer models.
   Expressed genes associated with metastatic potential were identified
   using high-throughput analysis. Correlations with biological function
   were determined using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and
   Integrated Discovery.
   Results
   We identified a broad range of metastatic potential that was independent
   of intrinsic breast cancer subtypes. 146 genes were significantly
   associated with metastasis progression and were linked to cancer-related
   biological functions, including cell migration/adhesion, Jak-STAT,
   TGF-beta, and Wnt signaling. These genes were used to develop a
   platform-independent gene expression signature (M-Sig), which was
   trained and subsequently validated on 5 independent cohorts totaling
   nearly 1800 breast cancer patients with all p-values < 0.005 and hazard
   ratios ranging from approximately 2.5 to 3. On multivariate analysis
   accounting for standard clinicopathologic prognostic variables, M-Sig
   remained the strongest prognostic factor for metastatic progression,
   with p-values < 0.001 and hazard ratios > 2 in three different cohorts.
   Conclusion
   M-Sig is strongly prognostic for metastatic progression, and may provide
   clinical utility in combination with treatment prediction tools to
   better guide patient care. In addition, the platform-independent nature
   of the signature makes it an excellent research tool as it can be
   directly applied onto existing, and future, datasets.}},

Abstract = {{The decreasing cost of genomic technologies has enabled the molecular
   characterization of large-scale clinical disease samples and of
   molecular changes upon drug treatment in various disease models.
   Exploring methods to relate diseases to potentially efficacious drugs
   through various molecular features is critically important in the
   discovery of new therapeutics. Here we show that the potency of a drug
   to reverse cancer-associated gene expression changes positively
   correlates with that drug's efficacy in preclinical models of breast,
   liver and colon cancers. Using a systems-based approach, we predict four
   compounds showing high potency to reverse gene expression in liver
   cancer and validate that all four compounds are effective in five liver
   cancer cell lines. The in vivo efficacy of pyrvinium pamoate is further
   confirmed in a subcutaneous xenograft model. In conclusion, this
   systems-based approach may be complementary to the traditional
   target-based approach in connecting diseases to potentially efficacious
   drugs.}},
